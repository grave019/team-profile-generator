  ## Goals

  To make a team profile generator that is easy to use and displayed the people correctly.

  ## Usage

  command line aplication

  ## Installation
  
  open --test-- folder in the integrated terminal. Then type the command npm test. Then a series of test will run on the employee, engineer, manager and intern. Then to build your team open index.js in the integrated terminal. type node index.js. You will then answer a series of questions and can build your team and have a web page generated from your series of prompts.  

  ## Test

  npm test in the --test-- folder.

  ## Problems

  Getting the html to generate correctly. It became easier after I moved it all to one file. In the future, I would like to enhance my skills and build into a series of files to make it appear cleaner.
